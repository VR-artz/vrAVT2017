    <h1>About</h1>
      <p>The Velvet Velvet, a fictional gallery. Every year, The Velvet Velvet features three to four larger shows about graphic design and architecture, with smaller monthly exhibits featuring work from local designers. Nothing on display will be for sale. The Velvet Velvet is like a free private museum of design scholarship meant to appeal to the whims of its foundersâ€”and hopefully the community.</p>
